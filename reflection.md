Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I worked with Anna Zhao, Yvonne Liang on this assignment.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to TA hours in 7:00-9:00 9/25
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's very easy to make mistake and not knowing where went wrong.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Similarity: Both can do Object-Oriented Programming Difference: Java's syntax is more strict, while Python's is more flexible. Java use bracket to separate different operations, python uses indentation.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Sometimes when I wrote more difficult questions like "I lkie you", instead of replying "You like me?", it replies"You like I?" because I mirrors "you" to "I" without considering different circumstances. This is because I start this assignment too late, so it only gives me very little time to refine my methods. Next time, I would start EARLY! (ps. I really want to go to Jordan's office hours, but there are no available slots for me.)
